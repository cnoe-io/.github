CNOE (short fo Cloud Native Operational Excellence) is an open source organization comprised of enterprise companies, sharing best practices on building, testing, and deploying internal developer platforms (IDPs) at enterprise scale.

- To start with a developer platform in a development environment, start with [the idpBuilder tool](github.com/cnoe-io/idpbuilder) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cnoe-io/.github/main/profile/images/github.png" alt="github" style="height: 15px;" />

- For testing purposes, you can launch [the idpBuilder tool](github.com/cnoe-io/idpbuilder) in [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/cloud9), [DevPods](https://devpod.sh/), or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
- To run the CNOE IDP stack on an Amazon account, check the [AWS reference implementation](https://github.com/cnoe-io/reference-implementation-aws) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cnoe-io/.github/main/profile/images/github.png" alt="github" style="height: 15px;" />
